# TextRecognitionInImages

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
   
Recognizing text in images has been an important research topic in computer vision for decades due to its various applications. However, the variations in text 
appearance in term of perspective distortion, text line curvature, text styles, etc., causes great trouble in text recognition. Text recognition in images is an
active research area which attempts to develop a computer application with the ability to automatically read the text from images. Nowadays there is a huge 
demand of storing the information available on paper documents into a computer readable form for later use. One simple way to store information from these 
paper documents in to computer system is to first scan the documents and then store them as images. However to reuse this information it is very difficult 
to read the individual contents and searching the contents form these documents line-by-line and word-by-word. The challenges involved are: font characteristics
of the characters in paper documents and quality of the images. Due to these challenges, computer is unable to recognize the characters while reading them. 
Thus, there is a need of character recognition mechanisms to perform image analysis which transforms images to electronic text format.

<h2>Features of our Model:</h2>

Our Model uses both the OpenCV and Tesseract module for Optical Text Recognition which help in enhancing the process of text detection in images and increases it accuracy and also used Tkinter for GUI which helps user to browse any images.
Software Requirements:
Python version 3.0 above
The following python packages must be installed :
- OpenCV
- Tkinter
- PIL(Pillow)
- Pytesseract

<h2>Conlcusion:</h2>
We have reviewed and analyzed the method for text recognition in images. The main purpose for building such a system was to fulfill the needs of growing 
content-based multimedia indexing, retrieval and management. We constructed the whole system using sub-tasks: the localization task and the verification
task in text detection and the segmentation task, the character recognition task and the temporal processing task in text recognition.
